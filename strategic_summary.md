Prompting AI transformed my role from problem-solver to pattern-spotter. Instead of jumping to fixes, AI helped surface contradictions between intent and behavior, revealing that growth was constrained less by market demand and more by internal operating logic.

The core principle I will carry into every growth diagnosis is this: scale fails where decision rights are unclear. Metrics don’t stall businesses — unresolved ownership does.

A Growth Consultant must embody all three mindsets:

Coach, to surface unspoken fears and identity traps

Analyst, to trace patterns across systems and signals

Operator, to translate insight into repeatable experiments

True growth work lives at the intersection of empathy and structure. The goal is not to remove the founder from the business, but to redesign the business so it no longer depends on the founder to function.
