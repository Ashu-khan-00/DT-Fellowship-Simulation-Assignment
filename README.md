# DT Fellowship Simulation Assignment
## Signal to Strategy: Boardroom Thinking for MSME Growth

This repository contains my submission for the DT Growth Consultant / Fellowship Simulation Assignment.

The objective of this exercise is not problem-solving, but **problem diagnosis** — identifying unseen bottlenecks and designing systemic experiments to unlock MSME growth.

## 🧠 Approach

This submission treats the founder not as a failing operator, but as a constrained system.

The work follows a three-step thinking process:

1. **Signal Extraction**  
   Simulating a founder interview to capture emotional, operational, and strategic signals.

2. **Bottleneck Diagnosis**  
   Using AI as a co-pilot to analyze constraints across:
   - Founder mindset
   - Organizational systems
   - Market and capability alignment

3. **Systemic Design**  
   Translating insights into repeatable experiments using a Growth Readiness Scorecard (GRS).
