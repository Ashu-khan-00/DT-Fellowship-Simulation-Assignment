Industry: B2B Manufacturing MSME  
Context: Growth plateau despite revenue increase

“We started this company seven years ago. Initially, growth was slow but predictable. Over the last three years, demand picked up rapidly, especially from mid-sized OEMs. Revenue has grown almost 3x since COVID, but honestly, it feels like we’re constantly firefighting.

I’m involved in almost everything — pricing decisions, key client conversations, production planning, even hiring approvals. I know that’s not scalable, but whenever I step back, things seem to slip. Orders get delayed, quality issues come up, or customers complain about communication gaps.

We’ve hired people, but I’m not sure they really “own” outcomes. Everyone works hard, but I still end up being the final decision-maker. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve hired too fast or not clearly defined roles.

From a market perspective, we’ve mostly grown through referrals. We don’t have a clear sales engine or positioning — we just say yes to whatever work comes in. Margins vary wildly across clients, but we haven’t revisited pricing in years because I’m afraid of losing customers.

Lately, I feel stuck. Revenue is growing, but profits and peace of mind are not. I work longer hours now than when we were smaller. I’m proud of what we’ve built, but I’m worried that if I don’t change something fundamentally, growth itself might break the company.”
